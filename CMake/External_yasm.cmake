# The yasm external project for fletch.
# This external project does not follow the normal pattern for
# fletch.  It is only used by the jpeg-turbo project and only when
# NASM or YASM can't be found. So, the usual enable flags and infrastructure
# for a fletch. Instead this file is directly included
# in External_libjpegturbo.cmake.
